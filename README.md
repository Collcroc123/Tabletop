# Tabletop
A Local Multiplayer Tabletop Game
Official title is TBD

Tabletop is a multiplayer game that is essentially a combination of two amazing games: Tabletop Simulator and Jackbox Games.
One person who owns a copy of "Tabletop" will be able to host a game, in which people with a smart device can join via a web browser 
(or mobile app if the browser is too slow).
Each person's phone/computer will act as their hand, so only they can see what cards or items they have. 
Everyone can see the main screen, which acts as the "Tabletop" (hence the name). 
Playing cards from your hand can make them appear on the main screen.

I'm still learning how to do proper networking in Unity, it's a lot more difficult than it seems.
